# AI-for-climate-action-SDG-13
This AI-powered project aims to support SDG 13: Climate Action by predicting Kenya's CO₂ emissions using socio-economic indicators and machine learning.

# 🇰🇪 Forecasting CO₂ Emissions in Kenya using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective

To forecast carbon dioxide emissions in Kenya using a Linear Regression model and open data. The model supports decision-making for climate policies and sustainable development.
